## Usage

### Basic Navigation

The Dynamic Calendar supports several URL patterns for navigating to specific dates:

- `/` - Default view (current month)
- `/[year]` - View a specific year
- `/[year]/[month]` - View a specific month
- `/[year]/[month]/[day]` - View a specific day

### Creating Events

1. Click on a date or time slot in the calendar
2. Fill in the event details in the modal
3. Click "Save" to add the event

### Customizing Views

Use the view selector in the top navigation to switch between:

- Day view
- Week view
- Month view
- Year view

## How It Works

The Dynamic Calendar leverages Next.js's App Router for handling dynamic routes and server components for optimal performance.

### Architecture

The application is built with a modern React architecture:

- **Server Components**: Handle data fetching and initial rendering
- **Client Components**: Manage interactive elements like event creation
- **App Router**: Enables dynamic routing based on date parameters
- **API Routes**: Handle event data and user settings

### Data Flow

1. When a user navigates to a calendar view, the appropriate route parameters are parsed
2. Server components fetch the relevant calendar data based on these parameters
3. Events are rendered server-side for faster initial loading
4. Client-side interactions are handled by client components for a responsive user experience

## Dynamic Routes

The calendar uses Next.js dynamic routing with parameters:

```javascript
// Examples of supported route parameters:
// [[...slug]] - Optional catch-all route
// [year] - Required year parameter
// [month] - Required month parameter
// [day] - Required day parameter
```

These parameters are parsed server-side to determine which calendar view to display and what data to fetch.

## API Documentation

### Calendar API

GET /api/calendar/[year]/[month]
// Returns events for a specific month

// Returns details for a specific event

POST /api/calendar/event
// Creates a new event

PUT /api/calendar/event/[id]
// Updates an existing event

DELETE /api/calendar/event/[id]
